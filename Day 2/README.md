# Day 2

## VS Code Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + Shift + p` -> command palette
- `Ctrl + B` -> Hide / Unhide Explorer
- `Ctrl + ,` -> vs code settings


## Extensions
- `Material Icons Theme` -> cool icons for files and folders
- Language IntelliSense & Snippets Extensions
- `Prettier` -> I used to use it to format code but now vs code has its own formatter which is based on prettier i think so, i feel its unnessary to install it as, the more extentions we have the bulkier the application becomes.
- `Better Comments` -> This comment lets you add highlight to comments using `!`,`TODO`,`*`,`?`
- `Quokka.js` -> gives you realtime outputs and errors while writing js/ts
- `Live Server` -> allow us to deploy our code locally
- `Auto Rename Tag` -> remmames the closing tag automatically based on the edits on the opening tag

## Tips
- `element.classname` -> Quickly create an element with a class
- `element#id` -> Quickly create an element with an ID
